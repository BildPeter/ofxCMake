# CMake for OpenFrameworks
This is not an ofxAddOn in the normal way. So do not just copy it into the '/addons/' folder and expect it to work.

## Installation
1. Find your main openframeworks folder (e.g. `~/of/`)
2. Create there a subfolder `CMake` -> `~/of/CMake/`
3. Clone or extract the git files and folders into this folder

## Usage

## CLion IDE usage
