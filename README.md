# CMake for OpenFrameworks
This is not an ofxAddOn in the normal way.
So do not just copy it into the `of/addons/` folder and expect it to work.

## Installation
1. Find your main openframeworks folder (e.g. `~/of/`)
2. Create there a subfolder `CMake` -> `~/of/CMake/`
3. Clone or extract the git files and folders into this folder so you have to following folders:
`of/CMake/addOns`
`of/CMake/libs`
`of/CMake/modules`
`of/CMake/project`
