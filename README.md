# CMake for OpenFrameworks
This is not an ofxAddOn in the normal way. So do not just copy it into the '/addons/' folder and expect it to work.

## Installation
- Find your main openframeworks folder (e.g. '~/of/')
- Create there a subfolder 'CMake' ( '~/of/CMake/')
- Clone or extract the files/folder into this folder

## Usage

## CLion IDE usage
